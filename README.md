# Data Structures and Algorithms

Algorithm: method to solve a problem

Data structure: method to store information

## Steps to develop an usable algorithm

1. Model the problem
2. Find an algorithm to solve it
3. Fast enough? Fits in memory?
4. If not, figure out why.
5. Find a way to address the problem
6. Iterate until satisfied
